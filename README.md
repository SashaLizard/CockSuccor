# CockSuccor
 MTG card image selector for Cockatrice. Requires Firefox to be installed, as it's used for webscraping.

 This is a small project I worked on when I noticed the need to change my card images in bulk. The package I chose for handling the UI is not ideal and comes with some kinks, such as having to resize the window for the scrolling bar to refresh. I also haven't added a feedback message for when a card is picked, and I realized later that can be confusing. In the end, the program does what it was made to do.
